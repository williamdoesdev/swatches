# Swatches

A color swatch tool which holds hex color values that users can copy to the clipboard.
A color picker can be used to grab color values from on-screen.

Color swatches can be saved as json files and opened again later. I recommend using a file extension other than .json like .swatch, .colors, etc. so that Swatches.exe can be used as the default program for that file type.
