# Swatches

A simple color swatch tool which holds hex color values which you can copy to the clipboard.
A color picker can be used to grab color values from on-screen.

Color swatches can be saved as json files and opened again later. I recommend using a file extension other than .json like .swatch, .colors, etc. so that Swatches.exe can be used as the default program for that file type.

Uses Philip Taylor's Neutron library for its GUI.

Uses Cocobelgica's Json library to parse json.
